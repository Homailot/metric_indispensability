# A Python Implementation of Metric Indispensability

This repository contains a Python implementation of Clarence Barlow's metric indispensability algorithm. The algorithm is designed to measure the importance of each pulse within a musical bar, where a pulse represents a subdivision of the bar. The concept of metric indispensability was introduced by Barlow in his article "Two Essays on Theory," published in the Computer Music Journal, 11, 44-60, 1987.

I developed this Python implementation as a necessity for my own project. Since I couldn't find an existing implementation of the algorithm in Python, I took the initiative to create one myself. My intention is to provide a helpful resource for others who may also require this algorithm in their projects.

You can use this for your own musical applications or research purposes.
